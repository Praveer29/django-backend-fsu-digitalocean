0:01 to 5:01 - [Music] [Applause] hey there okay I'm going to kick us off first off good afternoon and welcome to South Park Commons I think most of you know but SPC is for talented Builders and technologists who are trying to figure out what's next which we Define as the minus one to zero face we help our members build conviction to do their life's work um I am so excited to welcome Mark to SBC he was my first boss ever he needs no introduction as the founder and CEO of meta but today I really want to highlight him as a builder a hacker an original thinker Zak which also happens to be his handle um and really discuss you know how he's maintained the minus one to zero founder mindset um through the decades building meta and keeping meta at the Forefront of innovation um they recently launched um and open sourced their large language model llama 3.10 I don't have to tell anyone here yeah woo we live more open source here we celebrated in true SPC fashion with a Laton hackathon over this weekend um so so thank you for that as well um but with that let's kick it off Mark you've had a glow up in the past couple of years what what has led to this personal transformation well I injured my knee so I I was like all right it was kind of like I had my haircut short because I was like fighting and training before and then I was like all right I can't do this for nine months so like and by the way this week I'm officially healed so like ready for some violence um but um but I might I might keep the hair U but I don't know it's like I I I kind of had this sort of fro thing when I was younger and I I think Priscilla or someone was like hey you should grow that out I was like you know I'm not doing anything else for the next nine months so it's looking great it's looking great yeah it's looking great um on that note you've also been the main character in technology for the last 20 years how would you delineate the chapters you've seen and what chapter do you think we are in now I don't know I'm trying to be less of a main character you know I think like it's kind of working it's working a little bit for me to just like be a foil for you know other people um and um I don't know I mean we we've gone through all these different phases right I mean there was like the kind of early Facebook get it to work survive phase um I don't know I know then then like I'd say the last 10 years there's all like just kind of all the weight of the politics and volatility and responsibility around all that stuff has been just like a very different phase for the company and you know obviously that's not done but but I do think we we sort of now kind of understand the different dimensions of that and have done a ton of work to do the things that we need to do and um I feel better about that and I think that's allowed us to Pivot more to uh you know just offense and doing more kind of proactive awesome things and and when I think about the next phase um there are a lot of ways to do awesome things I think in the world and the the way that I think social media ended up being good is you know gives everyone a voice it helps you connect like like lots of people use it um I don't actually think it's super groundbreaking right I mean it's it's basically you're giving people like an ability to do something that's pretty fundamental and basic and it just required like really good execution um I think it's profound at Large Scale but I think the scale is the thing that makes it sort of interesting um so it's very much a you know one to n you know to use your your kind of analogy and I kind of think for the next phase of my career and what I want to do for like the next 10 to 15 years it's more working on just sort of breakthrough things that are more awesome and inspiring regardless of scale so you know obviously like for the the next Computing platform stuff that we're doing with like AR glasses and and the VR headsets and all that stuff it's like I I I do think we're going to get to a point where like billions of people are going to have are going to have these things I it's like billions of people already wear glasses so I mean it's kind of like you know everyone who just had a not smartphone easily upgraded to a smartphone and then kind of the rest of people were a little slower um I think here it's like everyone was glasses going to get smart glasses um maybe everyone else will will

5:03 to 10:03 - kind of come along or over time or or have different form factors but but kind of regardless that might that Journey might take like 10 or 15 years right and and I think that that's pretty normal for building something that's that fundamental in the world but the experience when you just try on the AR glasses for the first time and we have like our first working prototype of this now and it's like it's awesome it was it was actually working on this and I I like wanted it to be our first consumer product but I actually I want the first consumer version of it to be even better so we're just like all right let's like just take the first one and we'll kind of have it be a prototype but when people try this on they're just like it's just like giddy it's inspiring right it's like it's like it's just a thing that you haven't experienced before just being able to kind of like play with Holograms and things in the world as if they're I don't know if they're just like physically there and like a normal form factor pair of glasses it's just like this wild thing so any for for me I mean that's that's a lot of that I mean I think that there's that there's the AI version of that I assume we we'll spend some more time talking about that but I don't know it's more just like doing awesome things I kind of have the saying that I like to tell people at meta that there's a difference between doing good things and doing awesome things and it's like a difference in inspiration and good is good too I you can be awesome and not good there are kind of two different almost orthogonal directions but um I don't know I think this is a phase to try would be awesome and try to build some awesome things I mean it's interesting I think that you know one of the catch lines that we use for SBC is that you come here to throw away the good ideas in favor of the great ones so I think I'm going to update that so you throw away the good ideas in favor of the awesome ones um no I mean really because I think that life is too short I mean we the biggest scarcity that we have is just the amount of time that we have so I think we can all have good ideas but it's the awesome ones that we're going for um speak speaking of 10year arcs I think one of the things that we tend to forget you know in the Gess of these llm releases and particularly with llama is that you started Fair almost 10 years ago yeah uh in fact one of the last projects I remember working on with you at Facebook personally was coefficient uh back in like 2010 trying to put a weight on every Edge on our graph using machine learning techniques good one yeah it's I think it it it worked out well um so uh Ang being somewhat important I'm yeah grateful for your work thank [Music] [Laughter] you um so when but when you started investing in Fair can you take us through the early days of maybe what miners I mean back in 2014 we were still kind of in the AI winter um you know I think that so what was what were some of the seeds that you were trying to plant maybe back in the minus one to zero days of fair yeah so after I guess like around 2012 so that was when we went we went public and Facebook reached a billion people and I was kind of trying to figure out like what's nextt right because obviously Facebook goes on to scale to you know three plus billion people and it's still growing which is sort of mindboggling to I think like people kind of assume it's just tapped out but it's not still still doing awesome um and um it's uh but but at that point I was kind of like okay well what's what's like the next step and part of it was okay bu like one social app so that's good but there's there's kind of this Vibe of okay you can do it once like maybe there's some luck in that but like can we just go build like four more billion people apps or like take things that started to be pretty small and build them to be really big so that was one part and then it was like okay well what are the next platforms and this is something I thought about a bunch because like social media and and the apps that we're building kind of got started around the same time as smartphones right so we didn't play any role in defining smartphones and we tried later right it's like there's Android we took this cut at this phone thing it was you know the the the quick lesson from that is like all right this platform is pretty stable and solidified and let's like we're not going to really build to influence that much so even though it might take you know 15 or 20 years for the next major platform to come about and be at the same scale as phones are today like that's what I got to do right I'm not going to like hit my head against the wall just trying to like create another phone variant right when that when that when that thing is is is simp but and and also there there a couple of issues with with sort of building other on other platforms and one is just the lack of control over your own destiny which I think is just really frustrating I think when you're starting you're navigating all the stuff and like the wind is blowing in all these directions and you know there's like a million things that can kill you so it's not that big of a deal but then when you get to be a bigger company you're trying to I know you want to make like longer term bets which means that you want more kind of stability of the assumptions of your environment so having more control for the infrastructure that you know that you have and like knowing that like you build something someone's not just going

10:04 to 15:04 - to tell you you can't ship it or they're not just going to like change the ground underneath you whatever it's pretty important um another thing is I mean this maybe just be kind of more specific for me but like what but when you're building social apps it's kind of this weird thing that you primarily are delivering them through this tiny little screen that people carry around it's like a really in some ways antisocial form factor and and it's part of the reason why I care so much about glasses is just like such a more natural thing so okay so 2012 was right around when we kind of started looking at what's next and we started fair and we started and we bought Oculus right because at the time I was kind of this is actually something I think back about because I'm like all right could we have could we have started working on VR and AR without Oculus I'm I'm not sure I I mean I I think like in theory yes I mean we we like put a ton of work into it but at the time I mean you remember when when you were there it was kind of like like the ethos of the company at the time was not actually oriented around like let's just go like have some groups sitting in a corner for like five years building something separate it it was almost like we needed the separate seed of a thing to kind of go incubate it to even get like our culture to accept that it was going to be a thing even though i' kind of decided I'm like no we're doing this right but um so yeah so we got so we kind of started the the AI thing um with fair I did I did want to buy deep mind but they went to Google um um Demus was good by the way he he totally did a very good job of playing me off of Google to get a good price which which I respect and power to him respect um Power to him um but yeah so we we kind of did it ourselves and I I guess because we didn't end up having this closed lab um we ended up getting all these academic folks Y and that sort of laid the foundation for like the the kind of philosophical approach being like overwhelmingly open sourced on the work and and we we've done that with a bunch of other stuff at at you know meta Facebook at the time but U but the AI stuff I think especially was like really like it was kind of academic open Yan laon right like a bunch of the like the the kind of foundational people who brought in but I don't know it's I at the time it wasn't there wasn't like a product right I mean one of the things I struggled with for until until really the latest wave of the AI assistance came out is you know we really looked at this mostly you know it's like we did fundamental research it got its way into all of our ranking and recommendations and ads things and delivered really big results for the company but it wasn't like a a single product which sort of lacks a sense of Awesomeness in in kind of the sense that we were talking about before because that you know in the way that um like the alphao stuff or the alpha fold stuff that Deep Mind did I just think it's like really inspiring right it's like you look at that and you're like okay this is like like it's just a really kind of singular big contribution to the field y um so I kind of hit my head against the wall on that on AI for a while but I think more recently with the the Advent of being able to build different kinds of assistance um I I just think that's like the product hook right so we're going to have met AI it's on track to being the most used assistant in the world um feel good about that we're going to make it so every Creator and every small business and every person can create their own virtual assistants or you know virtual companions or the different things that they want you'll have NPCs in the metaverse playing games like all this kind of stuff I think that that's going to be awesome but it did take a while to kind of figure that out but I think it was back to 2012 2014 was sort of around the time we're like all right these are the two next things that we need to go do Ai and the metaverse I mean it's incredible to me just to kind of see how long you have to plant some of these seeds for yeah no it just takes so long I mean it's and honestly like it's way longer than I would have thought so I think that's like one of the lessons with entrepreneurship is it's almost like you have to be really excited about what you're doing because it's otherwise it's really uh too painful to be rational to actually do not rational um so you know one of the big open questions with AI has been kind of one of the I would say talking points that a lot of people say is that most of the value will ACR to either the bigger kind of like players uh either through either the bigger Labs or kind of like some of the bigger kind of uh whether it' be a Google or a Microsoft and that there's very little for the startups to essentially compete for simply because they don't have scale um and you're obviously both a big company but you're also kind of providing this incredible resources to all of us to kind of like push in some ways from the other side so how do you see like what advice would you have to this room full of Founders as they try to navigate like this particular question of like scale versus not scale like how do you compete against the bigger players and so on yeah I mean I think that there's going to be almost every product category I think is going to get disrupted there's going to be new stuff that can get built so some things are fundamentally very large investment oriented things and those are not well

15:04 to 20:04 - suited to startups so you know for example building large Foundation models that are going to train requiring tens of billions of dollars to train it's like all right they're probably just relatively smaller number of companies that do that um but I think the good news is that that hopefully will be somewhat of a commodity over time right and and I'm not sure that that's where most of the value is going to be um whereas what you can build on top of that I just think like all these different categories of of things you're going to get buil I look at like every part of what we do is going to get changed in some way right feeds are going to go from you know it was already friend content and now it's like largely creators in the future a lot of it is going to be AI generated um ads you're going from like advertisers targeting stuff to now it's like an advertisers just going to give us a business objective that they want and we're going to like produce the creative for them and find the people it's just like it's just kind of wild right I me all the meterse stuff it's like you go from like having all these developers building out these worlds to it just being more generated almost like a dream um like a loose a dream as you're kind of like walking through it it's it's it's going to be wild so there's going to be all this stuff like you can point to almost any product experience that's out there and I think that they'll change and some of that there may be some larger company that has some distribution Advantage but like I know large companies are slow and they lack conviction and um I I think this one of the advantage I think of being a kind of founder driven large company but one of the the the kind of things that I've thought about from time to time is like why was it the case that we were able to build Facebook and that some other company didn't right it wasn't like it was a super novel idea right it's I mean there was friender before there Myspace there's all this stuff Google Microsoft Yahoo they all like had versions of it why why didn't they do it and I think it's like I mean we kind of watched them right in the early days it's like fumbling around and it's it's not that they had a lack of talent right I mean we were like a rag tag group of children right it's like um and and they they had like all these like serious you know engineers and like serious infrastructure and so I I kind of think the the reason is because people Doubt new ideas before they before they come to fruition right so the narrative with with social networking is like ah just like this college kid thing it's like okay fine maybe not college kids but it's probably a fad oh okay maybe it seems like it's going to be around for a while but it's probably not going to make money oh it's making money but the switch to mobile is going to be pretty hard and then it's like okay by the time we figured that out it was too late for anyone to go you know for the companies have lost their their their advantage and so what was the issue I don't know there's like like there's probably some team buried deep inside those companies that believed in it and probably some like VP person who is like e that's probably not the biggest priority and just like you know pour some like I don't know sand in the gears or whatever your analogy you want and it just so I I do think that like even for the things that look like they belong to large companies as opportunities because they they have a big distribution Advantage I would guess that big companies are going to Fumble two-thirds of those right and then there are all these things where there is not an apparent new advant like big Advantage because it plugs into an existing distribution Channel and those are just kind of free and and kind of open to take but I don't know I I think that this is going to be huge and and the Llama thing that we're doing I mean like I I OB say I believe a lot in open source um I think it's good for for the world more broadly we're not doing this because we're like altruistic right I mean we're doing it because we want to build a platform that we know that we can rely on on having llama as a thing and the reality is is this is an ecosystem and it's not a singular piece of software that we could just build and deploy ourselves right it gets better when you have all the Silicon providers optimizing all of their stacks for the thing that we're doing and when you have all these other companies or startups or different folks who are building different distillation tools or um inference tools to make it go faster more efficient and all that stuff and you know all all these people are building stuff on it um and we released the segment anything model it's it's different from llama but you even in like the first week or two since it's out you just have like all these people running all these videos through and the model gets better right so um so I think this is going to be good for everyone I I I think open source is is kind of is going to is just it's it's kind of this question of like I don't know when you think about the future Computing platforms I think there's this huge amount of recency bias where people assume that because like iPhone won and and you know it's like that the closed model is going to win that just sort of like where the world is and I don't know it's I think that future is not written it's like like if you look back at PCS like Windows was the leading platform and there's there's kind of always an open approach there's always a closed approach each has its own pros and cons um but I I think a lot of this stuff just depends on like who goes and does it and I think that's true both for the startup opportunities versus whatever kind of lazy big company there is and I think that that's true for whether the open platform versus the closed one ends up being the kind of leading one in the in the next spaces whether that's AI or uh I'm going to jump ahead to my the next section and just one anecdote and kind of story I want to share that's

20:06 to 25:06 - actually uh been somewhat kind of I would say a defining moment of uh defining 30 seconds of my life which is that back in uh 2005 pretty close to when I first started at Facebook maybe like this is week two or week three um trying to figure out what to do nobody was really giving me much Direction uh and I remember Mark walked up to me and not like a very clear manager structure structure yeah exactly chaos chaos control chaos um and I remember Mark walking up to me and he's like hey dude I think you should um write a search engine for Facebook yeah just you yeah it's like you and what team right like and he it's really important because when people come onto Facebook the first thing they want to do is search for people so make sure you don't [ __ ] it up um and then my first reaction was like Mark I I don't know how to write a search engine I've never done this why don't we go hire somebody from Google or Yahoo to do this and he looked at me he's like dude if I can build Facebook you can build a damn search engine um and you did and I did I me it's like I me I there's like and and when I say it was the like 30 seconds that I still think about which is that I just think that we don't like all of us can build whatever we put our minds to yeah um and this is kind of the culture that for me still defines Facebook right which is that there's this hacker can do total ownership culture that if I could actually tell every startup in the world to like take one thing which is that all of you can do whatever you want as long as you put your mind to it it's probably easier than you think um there's a question in here I know I I I think it's sometimes it takes longer than you it Tak longer but like but it's but you can right and I think like a lot of the stuff that seems obvious that just not there's just not someone else who's actually like going to go do it right so I think that that's one of the things that's the weirdest about about this is it's like kind of comforting to think hey there are all these things that that kind of people should be on and someone else has got this right and it's like no no one else got this I think we're the grown-ups now um I want to go back to um llama and open sourcing llama for a second um I'm kind of curious like what kinds of real world examples do you want to see built on llama um I don't know I mean I actually I think that there's a lot of awesome stuff that will get built but I actually don't have a specific vision for that from my perspective I just want everyone to be using it because I think that the the more people who are using it the more the flywheel is going to spin for making llama better and I mean this is maybe like a very selfish and parochial answer but then that makes it so I can build the things I want to build better and um so but but honestly I think like people should take comfort in that answer because I think one of the big questions that people have about our open source strategies like why are you doing this like you're building this like you you kind of train this model and then you just give it away like is that sustainable I mean when like when llama four llama five takes many billions of dollars to train are you just going to give it away and it's like yeah yeah I don't view it as giving it away I view it as like you guys all making it better for me um so um so so I I actually don't care what you all do as long as it's responsible and and like and no I mean it's I think the safety is important right there are all these question around um around AI ethics and and Safety and Security and I think that that stuff ends up being really important we take a huge amount of time this is probably one of the biggest things that's part of training that makes open source difficult is if we were building it for just ourselves there are certain assumptions that we can make like that we'd have multiple layers of the stack in addition to just the model itself that could filter out bad stuff right so bad queries that come in outputs that it generates that are kind of unintentional and we've tried to replicate some of that with the open source stuff and we built this whole Lama guard system and it's meant to be deployed as like an overall system but fundamentally we have to put way more energy into training the actual underlying model because it can be used as just a model with all those other layers and that that I think is so maybe this is sort of a negative answer to your question but I mean pretty much I I think like part of what's good about having open platforms is people go build stuff that you didn't even imagine so I don't know I don't like know what to ask people to build I mean you all figure that out but but I think the the thing that that I kind of worry about with it is I I think some of the um but both the opportunities and the challenges around safety are bigger I I do think that it's not a lot of the open source safety debate has been framed around like okay because of what I just said open source must be fundamentally sort of less safe I actually think once you take that if you do a good job of it it gets more safe for the reason that open source software has been more secure over time it's just it's open it's you know it's like people can scrutinize it more it's counterintuitive first with open source people like hey well like hackers can see all the holes isn't they going to make it less safe it's like no you just fix the holes faster then everyone patches it and the same thing is going to happen with llama

25:07 to 30:07 - I think is that yeah it's like people point out issues we're going to keep on doing Dot releases we'll keep on doing big releases I think developers will keep on wanting to roll out the most recent models and they'll apply their fine-tuning patches to that to the most recent models and it'll be awesome so yeah I don't know but I think there's like the whole stack everything from kind of the silicon and the data centers and we did the whole open compute thing before sort of similar where I was like all right we're designing our own data centers and our own servers and let's just see if we can give this away then maybe the whole industry will sort of standardize around our designs and then the supply chains will get developed and the prices will go down for everyone and now and we have the advantage of we were kind of like we're after Google right so Google built all that stuff first so it wasn't like some proprietary thing for us we're just like all right whatever as long as it exists and it gets cheap that's awesome for us and I think we're sort of in a similar Zone on a stu I mean I'm curious I given the the front row seat that you have what's your what is this what is your best take on the scaling Frontier for these models I mean they continue to follow the scaling laws uh how much more Runway do you think we have I mean yeah llama 4 I think or you know whatever gp5 all of that makes sense but like how what's your current take on like the the runway and what are the Limited factors yeah it's hard to know um I think that there's the compute thing I mean I so without knowing exactly how far this scales I'm clearly betting that it does scale right because we're like doing all this infrastructure so it's and and so so it's hard to guess the exact timing and this is like you know five to seveny year build outs of like all this stuff for to to get to the massive scales that you want for like you know llama 10 down the road but it's um you kind of have to work on that in advance because you know they can train the model in six or nine months but like to get the energy that you need that's that's a long process um so I think it will I think it will work but um I think a lot of it is going to come down to data and a lot of it is going to be in different domains right so so that that there isn't data on the web for right so right now it's like you kind of think about this is like go out they look at all the content on the web you kind of try to find all the patterns in that that's your pre-trained model um then you you kind of fine tune it or Post train it in order to kind of build the different applications or things that you want as you start getting towards more like a gentic type behavior and it just that data set doesn't exist yet right so now you have to like go make that data set and I I think a lot of the new work going forward won't be just about kind of like taking data that's out there and then building compute to kind of crunch and train on it I actually think more of the training going forward will look like inference today to either be kind of trying to go experiment in in kind of some spaces right it's like how do you create an agentic data set it's like okay well it's probably some amount of manual work and some amount of just like letting the system play and and like and and just kind of experiment and generating data from its own kind of game playing um and that's just one example but it's like a type of thing that just doesn't exist today so I think that there's a question of how far does that go um I would guess pretty far and yeah I mean I'm definitely an optimist on this but but I mean tough to know exactly cool Richie do you want to rewind us back to some of the early days of Facebook I I mean just related to this I um you know adya has been talking about all his early experiences at Facebook I remember you know we were working on new speed and I was part of so many War rooms you were part of like the Pod of six people who built the first news feed it was like and I was sitting next to you all the time and it's not always a good thing but uh um but you know there was so many War rooms and lockdowns in the early days of Facebook particularly after we launched new feet I don't think I left the office for a whole week MH um yeah well that was because there were like protesters in the streets and the security was like yeah you probably probably shouldn't go out the front door because people are really really angry about this um right so I'm kind of curious I want to live through one of your more recent War Room experiences maybe like around llama or when the weights around llama got leaked or you know like what does a war room at Facebook look like today so I think that there's two different pieces to what you're so I think I'm not really in those like operational War rooms as much now so as much as it was with Newsfeed and things like that in the early days so I think how we process these like big strategic things that come up um I don't know I I feel like one of the things that I'm trying to do is learn how to run the company a little more smoothly over time I I clearly have not

30:08 to 35:08 - succeeded at this yet it's like like if you look at like the volatility in the company it's like ah it's um uh but but I I'm just like all right like at some point like in this life or the next I will I will like hopefully figure out how to do this a little bit more smoothly without compromising obviously trying to do really cool things right I think that the obvious way to make things more stable is to stop pushing the you know the put your foot down on the gas as much but I I am not able to do that um as a person um so but but I do think that part of it is like I I think we did used to run around with our hair on fire a lot and I think some of that was I don't know you like make up for lack of experience with more effort or something but but I think some of this is like you try to like it's time goes on be a little more stable about how you do stuff and so it's like all right when when the first version of llama it's like we intended it to be an academic release and it it like got out and I thought it was pretty cool and we were we were trying to figure out exactly like how to process this and it wasn't like a hair on fire situation I don't think it was bad it was awesome like people like really wanted it and we just need to figure out what were the right ways to handle this um a lot of the different crises that we have now now I think this is maybe an unfortunate artifact is maybe both being a bigger company but also just where the world is a little bit more I'd say more of the challenges we have are kind of like more social and political rather than technical right so the um you know it's like with Newsfeed the what were the what were the big challenges I mean yeah it was like this big change to the site but also it's like you launch Newsfeed and then immediately traffic on the site went up by like 50% overnight because it was just like okay now people can find all this interesting stuff that's being surfaced to them and it's like okay now we have to like okay how are we going to deal with that right it's like so you like corraled all the people and it's like all right let's let's kind of go solve that and and that's people want certain controls and we need to figure out like which controls to give them but now I think a lot of it is okay so people want this open source llama thing that we kind of accidentally half did right it's like it was intended to be open source but sort of like an academic thing to start and then it immediately you know so we had two debates internally one is like is this good and should we keep doing it and that got resolved pretty quickly it was like yeah we think this is good we should try to do this then the second one which I think it's because sometimes the some of the political or social debates they move so quickly I think the open- source debate I think is going to be one of the most important technology policy debates of the next 5 to 10 years and we have made a lot of really good progress already and I think part of the reason why why we're making progress is because so many people are embracing and using llama and um and and I mean frankly I think like like startups and Entrepreneurship are generally popular and like way more popular than big tech companies are right so so I think like like as like as a thing that we're doing like I don't know is that going to be popular by itself I don't know maybe maybe yes maybe no like when when you get like this ground swell of people who are using it that's it's like hey yeah I think like people are going to like people listen to that a little more and they're like hey that's good we want there to be new companies but in the early days before we actually did llama 2 which was the kind of like first commercial open source thing was this huge debate which is you know it's like the I'd say the the kind of like concern risk side of it was really I think dominating the public discourse until there were actually a lot of like startups that were using this stuff and that was really what we had to sort through internally was how do we do this in a way that is really responsible and safe given the somewhat unique nature of Open Source relative to closed and I and and kind of my my view is well if we do a good job and if we and if we kind of like over index on really making sure we do a good job on safety then over time you'll build trust and we'll build this community and like they're not going to want to take away open source from like it's I don't know if you think about like what are the big companies today it's like they were all built on open source software right it's like if if we if we if we if this debate goes well I think the next generation of major companies are going to be built on open source Ai and I I just think that there are some of these things where it's like yeah there will be challenges along the way that we need to deal with but I I don't know I think that this is going to be one of the most important debates and making sure we navigate it carefully and that's why we've had some more restrictions on what we do and and sometimes it's like a little bit slower but but I don't know it's less like okay we got to get in a warro and figure this out overnight it was I mean for from llama one leak to llama 2 it was you know probably I don't know how long was it it was it was several months right or like a bunch of months um yeah 6 Months 8 months something like that to to kind of sort through all that stuff and we were and the team was cranking on the model but in the background we were like I think figuring out all the responsibility stuff to make sure that we really nailed that and did a good job

35:09 to 40:09 - on that and laid the groundwork for the future awesome okay let's switch tax a little bit to address some of the questions that the audience has submitted um what is the one piece of advice you would give technologists who want to be entrepreneurs you know working with a lot of entrepreneurs here I find that they often hit local Maximas M um what kind of advice would you give them well I think the whole minus one to zero idea that you have really fits my philosophy of how you want to go explore the space I mean so when I think about when I was when I was getting started right I there's a lot of people who decide I want to start a company and then they like get really committed and they like go do a thing but the problem is that once you get a bunch of people like doing a thing it's really hard to change what you're doing and um and it's like yeah you can do it through willpower but it takes time and early on you're just exploring like a very Dynamic and Broad space and you need to be able to I don't know just have like meetings and make decisions inside your own head and then just be able to like go do things differently and like come out and like change your mind and it's like all right I'm I'm GNA like do a different thing now than I was doing you know a few hours ago and so I don't know so there's this the like when I was at in college before I built the first version of Facebook which I didn't think was going to be a big company by the way I mean it's um and do do you remember when like when Dustin and I first came out to we we basically I started Facebook he joined me because I I was still taking all these classes and I was like locked away in the computer science dungeon and like PHP doing my yeah problem sets and didn't have cell phone receptions when like the site went down like I was just it was just like oh I just like get out from doing a problem set it's like oh sight's been down for a while that sucks um so so Dustin joined and he and and he was awesome and like basically just kind of like the first engineer and kind of Ops person helping to keep it running and like the company wouldn't have worked without him Dustin's like an amazing person and um but yeah Dustin so after that first year first Spring right because I launched in February we came out to Silicon Valley and we're like hey this will be a great place to spend a summer this is like where all the companies come from we'll learn something it's like surely the thing that we're doing now is not going to be the company that we end up working we had already started Facebook it like had like almost a million people using it and we were like nah this is this is like not going to be that big of a company um so I I I think okay so what's what's the lesson from this so like when I was at in college I actually built like a bunch of different things um I just loved building stuff some of them were I like wasn't sure what classes to take so I built a service that like like went scrape the course catalog and let everyone input their like what classes that they had taken and what they were planning on taking and like it showed all these correlations of like people who took this one were kind of interested in this and here's how they ranked it and like and and and part of this was it was just interesting because it's like people like I kind of started that because I wanted to do this like crowdsourced question of like to answer what like what class I should take but it's actually just people just like sat and clicked through all the classes that people were taking because it's actually just like people really want to learn about other people right so it's like what like what classes are you interested in taking that's like an interesting signal on on on you and like an interesting way to get to know other people um so all that stuff I think pointed towards okay like put a lot of those things together into the first version of Facebook but there were there probably like 10 different things like I buil I remember yeah that was in high school with with D'Angelo um and yeah I mean it's there were like all these it's like I probably the peak was at some point I was working on some project and then I had finals coming up and there was this class I was taking the Rome of Augustus so it was like a history class said Harvard you need to take like some lit NS or I don't know what they call it now but um so you needed to learn for for the final what were the what is the like you just basically they' show some piece of art and it's like what's the historical significance of this so I was like all right that's like I have like I'm spent my whole study period building some other project so let's like quickly in a few hours just like threw together a thing like scraped all the pieces of art sent out a link to the class I was like hey I built a study tool um if you guys want to like look at this it's like it just shows a piece of art and you can say what you think is significant about it and then you can see what everyone else wrote and the scores had never been higher on the exam um but but honestly it's like so so I I I I really believe in this approach of just like you want to build different stuff and not get committed too quickly I I think especially when you're a startup right because it's I think when you're when you're bigger and you you can have it's actually a lot easier to predict where things are going to be in the world like 5 or 10 years from now than it is to know like what is your wedge to get there I think that's the really hard thing to figure out so I don't know I mean there's different styles on this some people succeed by just saying I want to go build a startup I'm going to like go hit my head against the wall until I get this to work but I've always much more believed in like just go build

40:10 to 45:10 - a lot of stuff that is like thematically interesting and like you'll learn different things from it and try to not get too committed too quickly because it's actually pretty hard to learn and fully kind of pivot through the space of things that you need to go do so I I think in and from that perspective my understanding is that like really aligns with what you're I think it's it's just really good thank you um a huge compliment to all of us here all of us here it's like I mean and you know just like you're good people you know it's like it's a keep going Mark all day you got a nice chain he's like you're a great Surfer okay um but you know I think I mean in that in that in that ve um when people ask me like the different things I worked on at Facebook I can I tell them that there are few things I launched that are successful but I also worked on a bunch of things that kind of just didn't make it right and I think even internally we kind of had this attitude which is that you should be pushing really hard towards kind of like what you think might be a great product but also not hold on to it so tightly that you end up almost getting your ego attached to it because you know like the whole point of building and trying is that a bunch of stuff won't work and that's okay and that's something I still admire about Facebook today which is that it feels as though that your con L pushing but with the knowledge that not everything will work and that's okay that's a feature yeah no I I I think I've made more public mistakes than like anyone else in the industry is there's there's some like Michael Jordan ad for this that I I always like find very inspiring it's like it really speaks to me it's like it's like this ad about how he's like like I've failed over and over again and then at the end he's like that's why I succeed but but I think it's um I don't know the Einstein biography that Walter Isaac done I think sort of makes the same point it's like like Einstein got all these theories wrong right and but it's like okay you got some good ones right right and it's like that's kind of what matters yeah um I think you talked about this but maybe I'll ask another question which is that you know I've worked for many startups and I've helped many startups as well but you know when I think of that early team at Facebook it gives me the choose yes we were in experience but it only gives me the chills and I kind of have C I'm curious about what you get right with the hiring um what are like you know some important hires you made and why were they the best people well I think it was sort of this uh Tale of Two Cities I think that there were a lot of really excited and inspired people who are coming out of college because they used the product and they were just like this thing is awesome like I want to work at at this company um and then the other side which I think I just failed at for a long time time was uh building an executive team and we went I mean it was we like flamed through so many Executives and and it's like because I I had this like platonic model in my head of like here's what a head of engineering should look like and I think that they were they were probably all pretty reasonable people but it was just like this big culture mismatch until finally Peter teal took me out to lunch one day and he's like all right like this clearly is not working well right it's like you like you um like you like you like aren't Jing with these Executives and like you should basically just take people who you want to spend time with because like you're you pretty much like live at the office or you know you're you're like working on this with your your whole life and um and I think that there's just sort of this kind of bandwidth thing with the the early team where it's like you want to be like speaking the same language and have a lot of you know similar kind of assumptions and obviously want to challenge each other too right I mean the the folks who were there had different views on things but I think also had enough of kind of like an overlapping Foundation of values and I think that was sort of when it started to click a little more we when to your point it's like embracing the chaos of some of the stuff being yeah it's like the people aren't quite as experienced but we're like a little more on the same page and I think one of the things that's been awesome about the company and where we are now is all these people have now grown up and now they're all like really seasoned amazing Executives who by any definition across the industry are extremely experienced and we've all worked together for like 15 years and it's like like so so people are like okay well how do you build that it's like you can't right it's I mean it's like you basically yeah you like I mean what I try to do is um I I basically I have a relatively large management team right because we we just we have a lot of different products and I I I basically like I want to be pretty Hands-On and to me part of that is I don't want to like work through just like six or seven people I have a group of like 25 people right who like run

45:12 to 50:12 - it's maybe like 15 product groups you know everything from the major apps to ads to AI to AI research to smart glasses to Mr headsets what all the different things then you have all the business functions and it's all there and we just spend like hours together every week and it's just like part of my style of running the company is like have it be kind of this bonded group and um I don't know I I like one of the things I'm really proud of is of the product folks I think on the business side it's a little bit different like you want to hire a general counsel who has a lot of experience as a general counsel right it's like that's like I think like really really important thing um but um although Chris Cox who who is the chief product officer and is like HR ones yeah yeah and I mean Dustin and I had this huge fight about this cuz like Chris was like he's clearly the very promising young man and it was like all right like and Dustin was like we need like I really need him to be an engineering manager I'm like Dustin you already have five engineering managers it's like I really need a head of HR and like like I I don't know it was tough it was tough to it was tough to hire days he was a good HR head he was great he was great and he and he was very generous to do it for a few years before going back to product but but yeah no it's um but but today even I me one of the things that I'm most proud of is of all the kind of like top product group leads none of them started at the company as a product group lead they all started kind of like one or two clicks down um you know we hire a bunch of people in as directors I mean some of the people who are at the company I me a lot of them start off as individuals I me one of them start off as an admin um actually two now um who who are on the management team um and just kind of like work their way up doing different things um you know people started non-technical roles came over to technical roles people start in technical roles go to other St so but I don't know I I think that that's it's been really cool yeah and it's just like a really good group and it's I mean you can like power through a lot of stuff yourself but I I really think that this I mean it's by the time you get a little further along with the idea it really becomes more of a team sport and the amount of fun that you will have and how painful the lows are really just depends on the people you have around you and it is hard right the stuff always takes longer than you expect it to and you like you have all these issues so I don't know I think to me that's probably one of the reasons why like I've remained excited and happy doing the stuff that I do is just like I love the people I work with they're like my closest friends it's amazing I just following up on that how have you managed the emotional ups and downs of starting a company running a company and how has that evolved over the last two decades yeah I don't know it's It's Tricky um I think some of the time when I think as the company's gotten bigger the Cycles are longer right so it used to be like you're saying it's like all right we're launching Newsfeed it's like we built the whole first version of Newsfeed in a pretty short period of time and then it's like there's the spike and then it's like ah like some people are upset and it's like okay a week later it's like sort of resolved and it's okay but like I think at the scale what we're doing now I think that's one of the things that's fun but it's also quite frenetic about building a startup and it's it just you do kind of always feel like you're you go you bounce between Euphoria and like feeling like you're about to die pretty frequently um I don't miss that um I it's tiring it's tiring I I'm I I don't think I could do that again um but um so now the Cycles are longer and I don't know I I think it's like it's some amount of willpower some amount of like the people around you keep you going and some amount of maybe you don't fully realize how bad certain things are until you're out of them and I I think that that's like like I mean I think some of the stuff that we've dealt with um I don't know I mean it's it just I think some of it you just like try to put one foot in front of the other and you keep doing your work and and then you look back afterwards and you're like wow that was really that was really something I feel like you know just hearing you say that I mean even for Mark the activation energy to start again would be really really hard so I think the only thing you can do is put one step one step ahead of the other and just keep going um and not give up I don't think you guys have a choice don't give up certainly not with RI here um so maybe uh switching uh gears to some um some fun stuff so during the pandemic um uh you know I I personally picked up you know a bunch of new sports learned how to ski uh call myself an intermediate uh professional at surfing um learned how to wake surf I can foil a little bit and

50:12 to 55:12 - it's been amazing right like all these Sports just going of give me an outlet to just be out in nature and learn a bunch of new things you obviously picked up a bunch of new things yourself um MMA foiling a bunch of other things um what do you love about kind of doing these Sports has has there been some amount of transfer learning between uh between these Sports and how you apply it to work so so for me the reason why I love MMA yeah is like I was just talking about how the cycle is very long when you're running a bigger company especially when you're doing Hardware right or it's like you're training like some Foundation model it's like all right let's we like go work on this for nine months and then like okay um so there is something that's nice in a bounded way about being being like all right I need to focus on this or else I'm just literally going to get punched in the face and like and like the payoff is pretty big it's like I get to punch someone else in the face it's like um it's like they'll never let me do that in the office anymore um you know all this ends with Alex Pereira kind of like in your in your what's up oh man Alex is awesome but um yeah no so I I think similar journey to you I mean I I I used to when I was younger be um pretty competitive athletically and then started the company and stopped doing most of that stuff and like and basically I'd stayed in shape like I like lifted some weights or something but I never I didn't have like a fitness goal for a while and then yeah at the beginning of the pandemic when when everything kind of went remote for a bit it was like all right um let's like get more into kind of running and you know our family spent some time out in Hawaii and it was um got into surfing and I was like all right this is really good right it's like because it's like you're own nature it's beautiful um it's like you're you're kind of physical but you're but it has a purpose you're like you don't want to get like crushed by the wave but it's fun when you're on it it's like strategic and then like since like all right so that's done I still spent some time out in Hawaii but I don't live there um so it's like what's the land version of this and it's like I need to learn a martial art and and then it's like everything just escalates right so it's like I started doing this with a few friends and we're training and we're like all right we we just train and one of my friends is like I'm going to go to a competition and I was like all right that's cool um I'm really curious to see how this turns out for you I'm like I'm not going to do a competition because that will be just absolutely humiliating right it's like I go and just get choked out by someone or something but then he went and he did pretty well and I was like no it's like if he if he get like that guy it's like so so like all right I'm going to the next competition so we went and like like won a bunch of medals and stuff then I was like all right so I negotiated with Priscilla that I can do one competitive MMA Fight Before It's was like all right look I could do Jiu-Jitsu for a long time but um but I feel like there's some limit to the Head drama that you want to take in this line of work um so it's like I was going to do one one competitive MMA fight and then I tore my knee and now I'm back he's back I mean what's the date for that one what's the date uh I I haven't decided yet I need to get confident with myy um but I uh I I don't know I would guess in the spring I I think like some some more time to ramp up you hearded here first I mean I mean I mean not to say that I mean let me give you another another anecdote about Mark's like competitiveness yeah just just just a little competitor just I mean maybe back in I want to say this is 2009 it was this you know Mark had a theme for you know multiple years this was a serious year so Mark was showing up in a shirt and a tie but then we decided that we were going to have a push-up competition to see who would be the first person in the office who could do 10,000 push-ups self-reported and Alex himl won and he now runs our AR Glasses program he won but Mark was a he was a close second I still remember being in not because of that just because he's been around for a while and has been doing awesome work and he was just like a dude like a random engineer at time and then like now he's one of the top people of the company right okay I've got the sign to wrap up so I'm going to ask the one last concluding question so the world often asks me what you're like um I try to avoid answering Isa sometimes don't make eye contact and walk away but you know sometimes I tell them you know he's like one of my closest friends that I would turn to In My Darkest Hours and what I find fascinating when I think about you is the more famous you've gotten the more time you've made for us um and I just want to ask you what are some things that are important to you uh that most people don't know to Value I I mean I think well we talked

55:13 to 60:13 - about the kind of physical activity part but and we talked a little bit about like the relationships part and trust but I don't know I mean going back to the first topic that we talked about with like building good things versus building awesome things I'd say for this kind of chapter of my life the there's one more Dimension to it besides doing awesome things which is doing awesome things with people who I really enjoy and and like want to like I sometimes it's like I want to go do a project because I like that person and want like want to go out of my way to find ways to work with them because I like they're a good person I want to help them um or I'm going to learn something from them they're interesting um and there's a lot of different things right I mean it's a lot of it I mean obviously the bulk of my energy is still it goes towards meta um and one of the really fun things has been sort of broadening out my relationship with Priscilla right it's like obviously we and we have a family now but we also have been running czi and that's just been really cool to like see her grow and basically lead this like huge organization um and then there's some stuff that's just sort of random right it's like I want to I want to like work on this project to like raise the highest quality beef in the world and it's like all right it's like and it's like why I don't know I I but it's like but I think doing it with some people who I think are awesome and um but I yeah I think it's like those things that's just what matters to me at this point and maybe it's partially because it's like the company's big and successful and I guess like yeah we need to keep on doing well in order to kind of keep a general momentum and keep things going but it's like it was never like getting to some value valtion or something that motivated me was always like what we were building and I don't know I guess like for this phas it's it's kind of being able to work on great things and being able to build these like really deep relationships I that's part of of of just doing stuff for a long time is I know when you're younger you don't have like friendships for 20 years yet because you're younger and and you just like and I think we're we're at a point now in our life where it's like oh yeah I have a bunch of and that's great but we're also young enough that we can build them they're going to take 20 years but but you but like but I think like you you can do that and that's just what's that's what what's important to me and and I mean and you guys have said a lot of nice stuff about me and I mean you guys are are some of my closest friends too and I mean I I think what you're doing is great and I the work that you did at at Facebook early on I'm eternally grateful for because we wouldn't be where we are without it um but you're also I mean I was joking about the support you guys are just really good people and I think the people who who you get to who get to work with you and get to be coached by you are really just lucky and fortunate and um and that's you know part of the reason why I wanted to come and do this is just because I I mean I you know I have a lot of faith in what you're doing and I and I think like philosophically it's like the right kind of push in the world um you know compared to other other different kind of incubators that have different philosophies or different different things like this and I don't know but that that's what matters to me at this phase of my life though thank you thank you [Music]
